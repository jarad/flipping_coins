# Coin flipping data

This is based on an idea from Matt Parker who filmed an experiment where he
flipped a coin a number of times. We are going to repeat that experiment with a 
set of "bitcoins". As true bitcoins are digital, these are just collectible 
physical coins with the bitcoin symbol. 

Our goal for the day is to flip these coins 1,000 times and record these flips
for future analyses.
